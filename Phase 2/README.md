# ðŸ“¦ Phase 2: Intermediate C++ OOP Concepts

This folder contains source code examples covering **intermediate object-oriented programming concepts** in C++. Each `.cpp` file demonstrates a specific concept with clear, practical code.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered

1. ### âœ… Constructor & Destructor
   - Learn how objects are created and destroyed using constructors and destructors.
   - Example: Creating and cleaning up resources automatically.

2. ### âœ… Copy Constructor
   - Understand how one object can be initialized from another object of the same class.
   - Example: Copying object state safely using deep copy.

3. ### âœ… Operator Overloading
   - Customize operators (`+`, `==`, etc.) for class objects.
   - Example: Overload `+` to add two `Point` objects.

4. ### âœ… Static Members
   - Use static variables and functions shared among all class instances.
   - Example: Track how many `Car` objects are created using a static counter.

5. ### âœ… Friend Functions and Classes
   - Allow non-member functions or other classes to access private data.
   - Example: Use a friend function to print private data, or a friend class to access internals of another class.
